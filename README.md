# JPACRUDProject
This project allows you to dynamically select, create, delete or update information on a web browser from a MYSQL database from which you can select which row in the table you want to change or view based on each rows unique ID. 

# Description
You run the JPACrudProject as a Spring Boot Application. And will have options to either enter an ID or Add a new row to the database.

If you choose to select by ID choose #2 as it is the only row present in a fresh install of this database without adding more yourself to your local version of the database.
